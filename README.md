## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic for anomalies.
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Utilizes known attack signatures to identify threats.
- **Anomaly-Based Detection**: Detects deviations from normal network behavior.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Logging**: Records all detected events for further analysis.
